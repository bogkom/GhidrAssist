## Quickstart

* If necessary, copy the binary release ZIP archive to the Ghidra_Install/Extensions/Ghidra directory.
* Launch Ghidra -> File -> Install Extension -> Enable GhidrAssist.
* Load a binary and launch the CodeBrowser.
* CodeBrowser -> File -> Configure -> Miscellaneous -> Enable GhidrAssist.
* CodeBrowser -> Window -> GhidraAssistPlugin.
* Ensure the RLHF and RAG database paths are appropriate for your environment.
* Point the API host to your preferred API provider and set the API key.
* (Optional) In the Analysis Options tab, set the Reasoning Effort level (None/Low/Medium/High) for models that support extended thinking.
* Open GhidrAssist with the GhidrAssist option in the Windows menu and start exploring.

## Build from Source (Ghidra 12.1.4)

For users building from the GitHub source ZIP rather than installing a prebuilt extension:

- **Tested build environment:** Ghidra 12.1.4 with Gradle 9.7.1.
- **Gradle is not bundled in this repository.** GhidrAssist uses the extension build scripts supplied by the selected Ghidra installation. The required Gradle version depends on that Ghidra version; inspect `Ghidra/application.properties`.
- **Recommended:** Use Ghidra's own Gradle wrapper. You do not need to install Gradle system-wide.
- **Alternatives:** Use a compatible system-wide Gradle, or install a separate Gradle distribution in your home directory.

From the extracted source directory on Linux/macOS:

```bash
export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR="/absolute/path/to/ghidra_12.1.4_PUBLIC"
"$GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR/support/gradle/gradlew" --no-daemon clean buildExtension
```

Run the command from the root of the extracted **GhidrAssist source** directory. The installable extension ZIP is generated in `dist/`. The GitHub **Code → Download ZIP** source archive is *not* itself an installable Ghidra extension.

See [Building from Source](docs/getting-started.md#building-from-source-ghidra-1214) for prerequisite checks, Gradle installation choices, and troubleshooting.

## LLM Setup

GhidrAssist works with any OpenAI v1-compatible API. Setup details are provider-specific - here are some helpful resources:

**Local LLM Providers:**
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics) - Easy local model hosting with GUI
- [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama#running-local-builds) - Command-line local model management
- Open-WebUI - Web interface for local models

**Cloud Providers:**
- [OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)
- [Anthropic Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/initial-setup)
- Azure OpenAI

**LiteLLM Proxy (Multi-Provider Gateway):**
- [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) - Unified API for 100+ LLM providers
- Supports AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Azure, and many others
- Select "LiteLLM" as provider type in GhidrAssist settings
- Automatic model family detection for proper message formatting

### Recommended Models

- **Open-weight models**: GLM, Qwen, DeepSeek, Nemotron, Gemma, and Muse are recommended families for local or self-hosted analysis. Choose an instruction-tuned, coding, or reasoning model supported by your runtime.
- **Hosted frontier models**: Opus, Sonnet, and GPT are recommended for code analysis and complex investigations.
- **Agentic mode and Actions**: Choose a model and serving backend with reliable native tool calling and multi-step reasoning. Extended thinking controls depend on the selected model and provider.

These are family names, not literal API identifiers. In Settings, enter the exact model ID or installed tag provided by your endpoint. See the [model guidance](docs/index.md#recommended-models) for selection criteria and official model resources.

**Reasoning Effort Guidelines:**
- **Low**: Quick analysis with less reasoning overhead
- **Medium**: Balanced reasoning depth for routine investigations
- **High**: More reasoning for difficult analysis, with higher latency and token use

**Note**: Evaluate models on representative binaries and tool calls. Local performance depends on available memory, quantization, and context length. Extended thinking can help with complex tasks, but response time and cost vary by model and provider.

## Using GhidrAssistMCP for Tool-Based Analysis

[GhidrAssistMCP](https://github.com/jtang613/GhidrAssistMCP) provides MCP tools that allow the LLM to interact directly with Ghidra's analysis capabilities.

### Setup

1. **Start the MCP Server**

2. **Configure GhidrAssist:**
   - Open Tools → GhidrAssist Settings → MCP Servers tab
   - Add server: `http://127.0.0.1:8081` as `GhidrAssistMCP` with transport type `SSE`

3. **Enable MCP in queries:**
   - In the Custom Query tab, check "Use MCP"
   - Optionally enable "Agentic" for autonomous investigation mode

### Usage Modes

**Regular MCP Queries:**
- Enable "Use MCP" checkbox
- Ask questions like "What does the current function do?"
- LLM can call tools to get decompilation, cross-references, etc.

**Agentic Mode (Recommended):**
- Enable both "Use MCP" and "Agentic" checkboxes
- Ask complex questions like "Find vulnerabilities in this function" or "Analyze the call graph"
- The ReAct agent will:
  1. Propose investigation steps as a todo list
  2. Systematically execute tools to gather information
  3. Track progress and accumulate findings
  4. Synthesize a comprehensive answer with evidence

**Example Queries:**
- "What security vulnerabilities exist in this function?"
- "Trace the data flow from user input to this call"
- "Find all functions that modify global variable X"
- "Analyze the error handling in the current function"

## Using the Semantic Graph (Graph-RAG)

The Semantic Graph tab provides a knowledge graph interface for exploring binary analysis results without requiring LLM calls for every query.

### Getting Started

1. **Index the Binary:**
   - Open the Semantic Graph tab
   - Click "ReIndex Binary" to extract structural relationships
   - Click "Semantic Analysis" to generate LLM summaries (requires API)
   - Progress is shown in the status bar

2. **Explore the Graph:**
   - **List View**: Browse all indexed functions with summaries and security flags
   - **Graph View**: Visualize call relationships with configurable N-hop depth
   - **Search View**: Full-text search across summaries and security annotations

3. **Security Analysis:**
   - Click "Security Analysis" to scan for security-relevant features
   - Results include: network APIs, file I/O, crypto usage, string patterns
   - Risk levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) are assigned based on detected features

### Explain Tab Integration

When viewing a function in the Explain tab:
- If the function is indexed, the pre-computed summary is shown instantly
- Security panel displays: risk level, activity profile, APIs used
- Click "Edit" to modify summaries (protected from auto-overwrite)
- Use "Refresh" to re-generate the summary with the LLM

### Benefits

- **Fast Queries**: Pre-computed summaries eliminate LLM latency for repeat queries
- **Offline Analysis**: Browse indexed data without API connectivity
- **Security Focus**: Automatic detection of security-relevant code patterns
- **Module Discovery**: Community detection groups related functions automatically
